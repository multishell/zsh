#compdef -K _bash_complete-word complete-word \e~ _bash_list-choices list-choices ^X~
#
# This function is for bash compatibility.  As some of the bash bindings
# are already taken up in zsh, only Esc ~ and \C-x ~ are bound, and
# you must add the rest by hand.  The bindings expected are:
#
# Esc ! -> command name
# Esc $ -> environment variables
# Esc @ -> machine names
# Esc / -> file name
# Esc ~ -> a user name
# 
# C-x instead of Esc with one of the above will list matches and won't
# attempt any completion.
#
# The following will bind the remaining set; simply put it in .zshrc
# after compinit is run.
#
# for key in '!' '$' '@' '/'; do
#   bindkey "\e$key" _bash_complete-word
#   bindkey "^X$key" _bash_list-choices
# done
#
# If for some reason \e~ or ^X~ were already bound to something else,
# that will not have been overridden, so you should add '~' to the
# list of keys at the top of the for-loop.
