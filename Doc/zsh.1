.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
login shell and as a shell script command processor\&.  Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles \fBksh\fP but includes many enhancements\&.  Zsh
has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"
Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad \fB<pf@zsh\&.org>\fP\&.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh\-workers mailing
list \fB<zsh\-workers@sunsite\&.auc\&.dk>\fP\&.  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson \fB<pws@zsh\&.org>\fP\&.  The coordinator
can be contacted at \fB<coordinator@zsh\&.org>\fP, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites\&.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date\&.  The sites marked with \fI(H)\fP may be
mirroring \fBftp\&.cs\&.elte\&.hu\fP instead of the primary site\&.

.SH "THE ZSH USERGUIDE"
A userguide is currently in preparation\&.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist)\&.  It can be viewed in its current state at
\fBhttp://sunsite\&.auc\&.dk/zsh/Guide/\fP\&.  As of this writing, chapters dealing
with startup files and their contents and the new completion system are
essentially complete\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/invoke.yo
.SH "INVOCATION OPTIONS"
If the \fB\-s\fP flag is not present and an argument is given,
the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute\&.  The remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
parameters\&.  The following flags are interpreted by the shell
when invoked:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-c\fP \fIstring\fP
Read commands from \fIstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Force shell to be interactive\&.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Read command from the standard input\&.
.PP
For further options, which are common to invocation and the \fBset\fP
builtin, see
\fIzshoptions\fP(1)\&.  Flags may be specified by name using the \fB\-o\fP option\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-x \-o shwordsplit scr\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
runs the script \fBscr\fP, setting the \fBXTRACE\fP option by the corresponding
letter `\fB\-x\fP' and the \fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP option by name\&.
.PP
.PP
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/compat.yo
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
Zsh tries to emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP when it is invoked as
\fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `\fBr\fP'
(assumed to stand for `restricted'), and if that is `\fBs\fP' or `\fBk\fP' it
will emulate \fBsh\fP or \fBksh\fP\&.  Furthermore, if invoked as \fBsu\fP (which
happens on certain systems when the shell is executed by the \fBsu\fP
command), the shell will try to find an alternative name from the \fBSHELL\fP
environment variable and perform emulation based on that\&.
.PP
In \fBsh\fP and \fBksh\fP compatibility modes the following
parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell:
\fBARGC\fP,
\fBargv\fP,
\fBcdpath\fP,
\fBfignore\fP,
\fBfpath\fP,
\fBHISTCHARS\fP,
\fBmailpath\fP,
\fBMANPATH\fP,
\fBmanpath\fP,
\fBpath\fP,
\fBprompt\fP,
\fBPROMPT\fP,
\fBPROMPT2\fP,
\fBPROMPT3\fP,
\fBPROMPT4\fP,
\fBpsvar\fP,
\fBstatus\fP,
\fBwatch\fP\&.
.PP
The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed\&.  Login shells
source \fB/etc/profile\fP followed by \fB$HOME/\&.profile\fP\&.  If the
\fBENV\fP environment variable is set on invocation, \fB$ENV\fP is sourced
after the profile scripts\&.  The value of \fBENV\fP is subjected to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a pathname\&.  Note that the \fBPRIVILEGED\fP
option also affects the execution of startup files\&.
.PP
The following options are set if the shell is invoked as \fBsh\fP or
\fBksh\fP:
\fBNO_BAD_PATTERN\fP,
\fBNO_BANG_HIST\fP,
\fBNO_BG_NICE\fP,
\fBNO_EQUALS\fP,
\fBNO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP,
\fBGLOB_SUBST\fP,
\fBNO_GLOBAL_EXPORT\fP,
\fBNO_HUP\fP,
\fBINTERACTIVE_COMMENTS\fP,
\fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP,
\fBNO_MULTIOS\fP,
\fBNO_NOMATCH\fP,
\fBNO_NOTIFY\fP,
\fBPOSIX_BUILTINS\fP,
\fBNO_PROMPT_PERCENT\fP,
\fBRM_STAR_SILENT\fP,
\fBSH_FILE_EXPANSION\fP,
\fBSH_GLOB\fP,
\fBSH_OPTION_LETTERS\fP,
\fBSH_WORD_SPLIT\fP\&.
Additionally the \fBBSD_ECHO\fP and \fBIGNORE_BRACES\fP
options are set if zsh is invoked as \fBsh\fP\&.
Also, the
\fBKSH_OPTION_PRINT\fP,
\fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP,
\fBPROMPT_BANG\fP,
\fBPROMPT_SUBST\fP
and
\fBSINGLE_LINE_ZLE\fP
options are set if zsh is invoked as \fBksh\fP\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/restricted.yo
.SH "RESTRICTED SHELL"
When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the letter
`\fBr\fP' or the `\fB\-r\fP' command line option is supplied at invocation, the
shell becomes restricted\&.  Emulation mode is determined after stripping the
letter `\fBr\fP' from the invocation name\&.  The following are disabled in
restricted mode:

RESTRICTED\fP
.PP
These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files\&.  The
startup files should set up \fBPATH\fP to point to a directory of commands
which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment\&.  They may also
add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins\&.
.PP
Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
\fBRESTRICTED\fP option\&.  This immediately enables all the restrictions
described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
files\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/files.yo
.SH "STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES"
Commands are first read from \fB/etc/zshenv\fP; this cannot be overridden\&.
Subsequent behaviour is modified by the \fBRCS\fP and
\fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options; the former affects all startup files, while the
second only affects those in the \fB/etc\fP directory\&.  If one of the options
is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding
type will not be read\&.  It is also possible for a file in \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP to
re\-enable \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP\&. Both \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP are set by
default\&.
.PP
Commands are then read from \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshenv\fP\&.
If the shell is a login shell, commands
are read from \fB/etc/zprofile\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zprofile\fP\&.
Then, if the shell is interactive,
commands are read from \fB/etc/zshrc\fP and then \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshrc\fP\&.
Finally, if the shell is a login shell, \fB/etc/zlogin\fP and
\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogin\fP are read\&.
.PP
When a login shell exits, the files \fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zlogout\fP and then
\fB/etc/zlogout\fP are read\&.  This happens with either an explicit exit
via the \fBexit\fP or \fBlogout\fP commands, or an implicit exit by reading
end\-of\-file from the terminal\&.  However, if the shell terminates due
to \fBexec\fP'ing another process, the logout files are not read\&.
These are also affected by the \fBRCS\fP and \fBGLOBAL_RCS\fP options\&.
Note also that the \fBRCS\fP option affects the saving of history files,
i\&.e\&. if \fBRCS\fP is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved\&.
.PP
If \fBZDOTDIR\fP is unset, \fBHOME\fP is used instead\&.
Those files listed above as being in \fB/etc\fP may be in another
directory, depending on the installation\&.
.PP
As \fB/etc/zshenv\fP is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that
it be kept as small as possible\&.  In particular, it is a good idea to
put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind
a test of the form `\fBif [[ \-o rcs ]]; then \&.\&.\&.\fP' so that it will not
be executed when zsh is invoked with the `\fB\-f\fP' option\&.
.PP
Any of these files may be pre\-compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin
command (see \fIzshbuiltins\fP(1))\&.  If a compiled file exists (named for the original file plus the
\fB\&.zwc\fP extension) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
file will be used instead\&.
